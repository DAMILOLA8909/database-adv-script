# üß† Advanced SQL Joins ‚Äì Airbnb Database Script

This project demonstrates the use of **different SQL JOIN operations** as part of the **Advanced SQL: Complex Queries, Indexing, and Optimization** module.

It includes:
- Table creation scripts  
- Sample data inserts  
- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN examples  

---

## üéØ Objective
Master SQL joins by writing complex queries using:
- **INNER JOIN** ‚Üí Retrieve related records across tables  
- **LEFT JOIN** ‚Üí Include unmatched records from the left table  
- **FULL OUTER JOIN** ‚Üí Retrieve all records from both tables

## üß© Database Schema

| Table | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `users` | Stores user information |
| `properties` | Contains property listings |
| `bookings` | Links users to properties through reservations |
| `reviews` | Contains user reviews for properties |

## üßæ Queries Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ INNER JOIN
**Goal:** Retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings.

```sql
SELECT 
    users.user_id,
    users.name AS user_name,
    bookings.booking_id,
    bookings.property_id,
    bookings.booking_date
FROM 
    users
INNER JOIN 
    bookings 
ON 
    users.user_id = bookings.user_id;
```

#### üìò Explanation:
This query only returns records where there is a matching user_id in both users and bookings.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ LEFT JOIN

Goal: Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.

```sql
SELECT 
    properties.property_id,
    properties.name AS property_name,
    reviews.review_id,
    reviews.rating,
    reviews.comment
FROM 
    properties
LEFT JOIN 
    reviews 
ON 
    properties.property_id = reviews.property_id;
```

#### üìò Explanation:
This query returns all properties, even if they don‚Äôt have a review.
If a property has no review, the review_id, rating, and comment will be NULL.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ FULL OUTER JOIN

Goal: Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if a user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.

```sql
SELECT 
    users.user_id,
    users.name AS user_name,
    bookings.booking_id,
    bookings.property_id,
    bookings.booking_date
FROM 
    users
LEFT JOIN 
    bookings 
ON 
    users.user_id = bookings.user_id

UNION

SELECT 
    users.user_id,
    users.name AS user_name,
    bookings.booking_id,
    bookings.property_id,
    bookings.booking_date
FROM 
    users
RIGHT JOIN 
    bookings 
ON 
    users.user_id = bookings.user_id;
```

#### üìò Explanation:
Since MySQL does not support FULL OUTER JOIN, this query uses a combination of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN with UNION to simulate the same behavior.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1. Make sure your MySQL server is running.

2. Create and select your database:
```bash
mysql -u <your_username> -p
CREATE DATABASE airbnb_db;
USE airbnb_db;
```
3. Execute the script::
```bash
mysql -u <your_username> -p airbnb_db < database-adv-script/joins_queries.sql
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Learning Outcomes

By the end of this task, you should be able to:

    - Understand and apply INNER, LEFT, and FULL OUTER JOINs

    - Retrieve relational data from multiple tables

    - Write clean, efficient, and testable SQL join queries

    - Analyze how different joins affect result sets
